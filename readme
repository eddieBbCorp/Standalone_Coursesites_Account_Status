The purpose of the email verification URL is to ensure that the email address we have received from the user is real as we keep a record of it. If you need to use this portal to retrieve the URL because the user has not received the email with the link in as generated by the system (it may have been trapped in spam/junk filters for example), please copy the link into an email and send it to the email address shown on screen. DO NOT copy the link directly into a chat conversation or send it to a different email address if the user requests it.
